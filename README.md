Terraform module to provision an Elastic MapReduce (EMR) cluster on AWS.


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).
>
> <details>
> <summary><strong>Watch demo of using Atmos with Terraform</strong></summary>
> <img src="https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/blob/main/docs/demo.gif?raw=true"/><br/>
> <i>Example of running <a href="https://atmos.tools"><code>atmos</code></a> to manage infrastructure from our <a href="https://atmos.tools/quick-start/">Quick Start</a> tutorial.</i>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
